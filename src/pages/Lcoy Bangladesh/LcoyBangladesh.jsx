        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>
          Local Conference of Youths (LCOYs) are official regional youth conferences recognized under the banner of YOUNGO, the official youth constituency of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC). LCOYs provide a national and localized platform for youth to engage in climate action, policy advocacy, and governance. They serve as preparatory spaces for the Global Conference of Youth (COY), which precedes the UN Climate Change Conference of Parties (COP).
        </p>
        <p>
          LCOYs enable young people to contribute to climate dialogues through a structured, participatory process. These conferences bridge the gap between grassroots youth initiatives and global policy frameworks by amplifying local perspectives and ensuring that youth voices inform climate governance. Over the years, LCOYs have been crucial in mobilizing young people, strengthening climate leadership, and producing national youth statements that influence climate negotiations.
        </p>
        <p>
          In 2025, LCOY Bangladesh aims to elevate this platform by focusing on the "Red Spirit," referring to the July Movement of 2024, an iconic youth-led revolution advocating for justice, governance reforms, and meaningful participation. This year's LCOY will reinforce youth engagement in climate governance, leveraging the momentum of past movements to create lasting change.

            <h3>Mission:</h3>
            <p>
              LCOY Bangladesh 2025 seeks to serve its true purpose by creating a unified and impactful platform for all youth-led entities working on climate, justice, development, and governance in Bangladesh. It will promote meaningful youth engagement in climate governance by fostering informed actions towards just transition, advocating for policy change, and strengthening young people's capacities.

            <h3>Vision:</h3>
            <p>
              LCOY BD 2025 envisions an outcome where young people in Bangladesh are recognized as key stakeholders in climate governance and play a decisive role in shaping sustainable policies and actions through integrated, collective youth climate justice movements, youth empowerment and community mobilization.

        <h2>Themes</h2>
        <p>
          LCOY Bangladesh 2025 will focus on three key themes: Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs), Just Transition, and Climate Governance. These themes are strategically chosen to align with national and global climate priorities while ensuring meaningful youth engagement.
        </p>

        <div className="theme-cards">
          <div className="theme-card">
            <h3>Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)</h3>
            <p>
              NDCs are going to be heavily discussed throughout the year. 2025 is the year of people's NDCs, 2025 is also the year when countries submit their 3rd and most probably the last round of NDCs. LCOY BD 2025 will focus on ensuring meaningful youth engagement in Bangladesh's 3rd round of NDCs by pushing for the adoption of youth clauses in the document, enhancing the capacity of young people in their roles in the national document, and bringing in well-informed youth in the NDC tracking and quality control processes.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="theme-card">
            <h3>Just Transition</h3>
            <p>
              As Bangladesh moves towards a low-carbon economy, ensuring a just transition is essential to protect workers, marginalized communities, and those dependent on fossil fuel industries. A just transition prioritizes social equity, economic opportunities, and sustainable livelihoods while phasing out unsustainable practices. To prioritize climate justice, the COP presidency, parties, and constituencies are already putting much emphasis on Just Transition as one of the important discussion points of COP30 this year. Through this theme, LCOY BD 2025 will engage youth in discussions on green jobs, skills development, and equitable climate solutions that leave no one behind.
            </p>
          </div>

          <div className="theme-card">
            <h3>Climate Governance</h3>
            <p>
              Effective climate governance is crucial for implementing climate policies and ensuring accountability. Despite numerous climate policies and commitments, gaps in implementation, transparency, and inclusivity persist. Youth must actively participate in governance structures to hold decision-makers accountable and to drive policy action to enable Bangladesh to meaningfully contribute to the global goal on adaptation. This theme will equip young people with the knowledge and tools to navigate climate governance systems, advocate for reforms, and co-create solutions with policymakers.
